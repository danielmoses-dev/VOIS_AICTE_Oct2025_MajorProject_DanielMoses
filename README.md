# Netflix Data Analysis â€“ VOIS x Edunet Foundation Internship

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **VOIS (Vodafone Intelligent Solutions)** x **Edunet Foundation** 4-week internship, focused on applying data analysis and visualization skills to real-world datasets. The objective was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights into content trends, genre distributions, and platform evolution over time.

---

## Objectives

The primary goals of this analysis were:

* To understand the **distribution of Movies and TV Shows** on Netflix.
* To analyze **content release trends** over the years.
* To identify the **most common genres** and their evolution.
* To explore **country-wise content contribution**.
* To examine **duration patterns** for both movies and TV shows.
* To analyze **ratings and maturity distribution** across the platform.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** â€“ Core programming language
* **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Development and documentation environment
* **Pandas** â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing
* **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization

---

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Key steps taken before analysis:

* **Handling missing values** in columns like `Director`, `Country`, and `Rating`.
* **Splitting the `Duration` column** into two parts:

  * `Duration_Value` (numeric)
  * `Duration_Unit` (minutes or seasons)
* **Extracting `Year` and `Month`** from the `Release_Date` column.
* **Removing duplicates** and verifying data integrity.
